# =============================================================================
# Pylint configuration for module_5 (beginner-friendly explanation)
# =============================================================================
#
# What is this file?
# ------------------
# When you run "pylint src tests", Pylint looks for a config file like
# .pylintrc in the current directory. This file tells Pylint which rules to
# apply and which to ignore. Without it, Pylint uses its defaults and may
# report hundreds of messages.
#
# Understanding message codes
# --------------------------
# Each Pylint check has a code. The first letter tells you the category:
#
#   E = Error (likely a bug or bad practice)
#   W = Warning (suspicious but might be intentional)
#   R = Refactor (suggests a cleaner way to write the code)
#   C = Convention (style: naming, docstrings, imports, etc.)
#
# The numbers (e.g. 1101, 0915) are just IDs for that specific rule.
#
# What does "disable=" do?
# -----------------------
# The [MESSAGES CONTROL] section lists check codes we turn OFF for this
# project. We do that for three reasons:
#
#   1. FALSE POSITIVES — Pylint is wrong for our code.
#      Example: E1101 (no-member). We use psycopg connections that have
#      .cursor() and .close() at runtime, but Pylint doesn't understand
#      that and says "has no member". Disabling E1101 hides that incorrect
#      complaint.
#
#   2. TOO STRICT / BIG REFACTORS — Fixing would mean rewriting a lot.
#      Example: R0915 (too-many-statements) and R0801 (duplicate-code).
#      Our query_data and app have many statements and some repeated SQL;
#      fixing would require splitting into many small functions or shared
#      modules. For this project we allow the current structure.
#
#   3. STYLE CHOICES — We don't want to enforce that style here.
#      Example: C0116 (missing-function-docstring). Requiring a docstring
#      on every test function and helper would be noisy; many test files
#      don't use them. So we disable missing-docstring checks.
#
# [BASIC] and [DESIGN]
# --------------------
# These sections set LIMITS instead of turning off a check entirely.
#
#   max-line-length=100  — Lines can be up to 100 characters (default is 80).
#   max-args=15          — A function can have up to 15 parameters.
#   max-locals=25        — A function can have up to 25 local variables.
#   max-branches=25       — A function can have up to 25 if/else branches.
#   max-statements=100    — A function can have up to 100 statements.
#
# Our app and query_data have large functions; these limits allow that
# without triggering "too many" messages.
